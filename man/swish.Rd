\title{swish: SAMseq With Inferential Samples Helps}
\usage{
swish(y, x, cov = NULL, pair = NULL, interaction = FALSE,
  nperms = 30, estPi0 = FALSE, qvaluePkg = "qvalue", pc = 5,
  nRandomPairs = 30, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a SummarizedExperiment containing the inferential replicate
matrices of median-ratio-scaled TPM as assays 'infRep1', 'infRep2', etc.}

\item{x}{the name of the condition variable. A factor with two
levels for a two group analysis (possible to adjust for covariate
or matched samples, see next two arguments)}

\item{cov}{the name of the covariate for adjustment.
If provided a stratified Wilcoxon in performed.
Cannot be used with \code{pair}}

\item{pair}{the name of the pair variable, which should be the
number of the pair. Can be an integer or factor.
If specified, a signed rank test is used
to build the statistic. All samples across \code{x} must be
pairs if this is specified. Cannot be used with \code{cov}.}

\item{interaction}{logical, whether to perform a test of an interaction
between \code{x} and \code{cov}. These are different than the other
tests produced by the software, in that they focus on a difference
in the log2 fold change across levels of \code{x} when comparing
the two levels in \code{cov}. If \code{pair} is specified, this
will perform a Wilcoxon rank sum test on the two groups
of matched sample LFCs. If \code{pair} is not included, multiple
random pairs of samples within the two groups are chosen,
and again a Wilcoxon rank sum test compared the LFCs across groups.}

\item{nperms}{the number of permutations}

\item{estPi0}{logical, whether to estimate pi0}

\item{qvaluePkg}{character, which package to use for q-value estimation,
\code{samr} or \code{qvalue}}

\item{pc}{pseudocount for finite estimation of \code{log2FC}, not used
in calculation of test statistics, \code{locfdr} or \code{qvalue}}

\item{nRandomPairs}{the number of random pseudo-pairs (only used with
\code{interaction=TRUE} and un-matched samples) to use to calculate
the test statistic}

\item{quiet}{display no messages}
}
\value{
a SummarizedExperiment with metadata columns added:
the statistic (either a centered Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney
or a signed rank statistic, aggregated over inferential replicates),
a log2 fold change (the median over inferential replicates,
and averaged over pairs or groups (if groups, weighted by sample size),
the local FDR and q-value, as estimated by the \code{samr} package.

\references{
\code{swish} is described in the following reference:

Anqi Zhu, Avi Srivastava, Joseph G Ibrahim, Rob Patro, Michael I Love
"Nonparametric expression analysis using inferential replicate counts"
Nucleic Acids Research (2019).

The \code{swish} method builds upon the \code{SAMseq} method,
and extends it by incorporating inferential uncertainty.
\code{swish} internally calls functions from the \code{samr}
package, for example, the calculation of local FDR and q-value.
